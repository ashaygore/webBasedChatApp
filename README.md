A few optimiizations are expected as:

1.After joining room and sending few messages,if user refreshes the chat page,messages shouldn't vanish.
For that feature,we'll have to add a message array in the server and store the messages roomwise and some technique will be found out so that on refresh  all the messages may be retrieved from the server.

2.As vasu sir suggested,export the whole present chat into .txt file.
